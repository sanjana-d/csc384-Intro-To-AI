1. Explain what the calculations above might or might not tell you about the "fairness" of your Naive Bayesian network. Explain in 50-100 words.
The model is trained on a dataset adult-train.csv which comprises of many more males than females. Training on an imbalanced data often results in unfair models.
In our case, the model has a lot more information about males tham it does females.
Hence when predicting probabilities for females, it might not be accurate resulting in unfair predictions and biases towards males.
If percentages differ greatly for females with predicted salary over >=50K (8%) vs males with predicted salary over >=50K (25%) then the model displays potential bias.



2. Would you be willing to use your model to recommend starting salaries for employees at a firm? Why or why not? Explain in 50-100 words.
The model may sometimes provide good predictions based on historical data, however it can also show
bias depending on the training data. If historically only males were mostly hired by the company, it means that the data is not diverse enough 
and will keep prediciting lower salaries for other genders. Hence, I would not use my model since it shows bias and was trained on not-diverse data
